# scipy2017

This repository includes slides and code from a talk given by Eric Bruning at SciPy 2017 on 12 July 2017. A video of the talk is available  [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/b06pe1ocmmI?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GfdAFycPLBdUDOUtdQIVoMf) as part of the [larger playlist from SciPy 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GfdAFycPLBdUDOUtdQIVoMf).

The traversal demo code relies on numpy and xarray. It requires Python 3.

The unit tests provide a demonstration of how to use the `OneToManyTraversal` class.

This repository does not include code for working directly with GLM data. However, such code exists and is available by request though a private repository. Once GLM access restrictions are loosened, the GLM reader code will be made public for the community. In the meantime. Please contact eric.bruning@ttu.edu.
